Service Dash
===

The idea behind this project is to create a lightweight dashboard to view logs and the overall health and status of MYKOBO services.

We should have a TUI that can list clusters and then when a cluster is selected we should list services in the cluster. When a service is selected we should tail logs of that service.

We should be able to provide a menu when a service is selected and the menu options will be `view logs` and `redeploy service`
